                    <p>REXBURG — A trio of brothers successfully surpassed their fundraising goal to help refugees due
                        to the outpouring of support from eastern Idahoans.

                        Cocoa for a Cause is a fundraising baked goods stand that was started six years ago in
                        Snohomish, Washington as a philanthropic effort by now 13-year-old Benjamin Mahelona. Benjamin’s
                        family moved to Rexburg about three months ago. He wanted to start the stand again in his new
                        community.

                        Benjamin and his two brothers Caleb, 9, and Desmond, 5, along with the help of his mother, sold
                        hot chocolate, brownies, cookies, muffins and other baked goods. This year, the brothers agreed
                        to raise money and donate it to refugees through the International Rescue Committee. The money
                        will help buy school supplies, blankets, toolkits and emergency food.

                    <p>REXBURG — Vocal Affinity, a Rexburg-based choir group will examine major themes and the meaning
                        of Christmas when they perform their “O Wondrous Mystery” concert at the Rexburg Tabernacle this
                        weekend.

                        “O Wondrous Mystery” focuses on the birth of Jesus Christ but uses its music to tell that story
                        from a different perspective than is usually portrayed.

                        “This one is called ‘O Wondrous Mystery’ because we’re looking at it from a more solemn, more
                        mysterious, darker view,” Vocal Affinity Artistic Director David Torres told EastIdahoNews.com.

                        Torres said the concert will open with the choir performing “John Rutter’s Requiem,” a piece
                        that would usually be sung at funerals. The piece captures the uncertainty of people living
                        before Christ was born.

                            <p>A large majority of The Rexburg community comes from the students traveling all around
                                the world to be here, but there would be no school if not for the town to stabilize the
                                School and provide services. The townspeople are so accommodating, that it is not
                                unusual for students to plant roots in Rexburg after graduating. Because of this, our
                                town has seen an increase in the median age that lives in Rexburg. From 2012 to 2018
                                alone we have seen the median age from 21 to 24, and because of the booming growth, we
                                know it will only continue to go up into middle age.
                            </p>
                            <p>A lot of our townsfolk have started unique businesses in Rexburg. For example, we have
                                one gentleman, who started Soup for You, LLC in downtown Rexburg where he makes multiple
                                types of bread and soup. As uninteresting as that sounds, he has taken a kind twist to
                                it and will go out of his way to make the soups you want. He also supports his
                                neighboring businesses in whatever way he can, because like most all Rexburgians, he
                                cares about this community. He makes different soups every day, so if you want
                                something, you have to go grab it ASAP!.</p>

                            new businesses are being built or moving in every month.
                        </p>

                        Idaho, it is an ideal place to stay while going on your next outdoor adventure since it is
                        surrounded by national forests on all sides, the most notable being Yellowstone. Another thing
                        Rexburg is proud of is our culture of trying something new. There is something for everyone

                <p>Rexburg was founded in 1883 by a group of pioneers. These pioneers were sent by the Church of Jesus
                    Christ of Latter Day Saints in Salt Lake and the leader over that group of pioneers was Thomas E.
                    Ricks. Rexburg was quickly named after Ricks and later they built Ricks college, later named Brigham
                    Young University-Idaho.


                </p>
                <p>Rexburg has survived one of the largest floods caused by a faulty dam the country has ever seen. It
                    is aptly named the Teton Dam Flood.In other noteworthy events about Rexburg, we have the largest
                    schnauzers per capita than any other place in the nation. We have also been mentioned in a Johnny
                    Cash song, seen in a supernatural TV episode, and had every major news station in the nation come to
                    rexburg to give updates on the disappearance and murder of the Vallow sibilinngs in 2019 and 2020.
